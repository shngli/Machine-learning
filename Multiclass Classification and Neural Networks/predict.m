function p = predict(Theta1, Theta2, X)
%PREDICT Predict the label of an input given a trained neural network
%   p = PREDICT(Theta1, Theta2, X) outputs the predicted label of X given the
%   trained weights of a neural network (Theta1, Theta2)

% Useful values
m = size(X, 1);
num_labels = size(Theta2, 1);

% You need to return the following variables correctly 
p = zeros(size(X, 1), 1);

% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: Complete the following code to make predictions using
% your learned neural network. You should set p to a 
% vector containing labels between 1 to num_labels.
%
% Hint: The max function might come in useful. In particular, the max
% function can also return the index of the max element, for more
% information see 'help max'. If your examples are in rows, then, you
% can use max(A, [], 2) to obtain the max for each row.
%

% Input Layer
% Add ones to the X data matrix
a1 = [ones(m, 1) X]; % results in [5000, 401]

% Calculate the first hidden layer of the NN
% size(a1) = 5000 * 401
% Theta1 = 401 * 25
z2 = a1 * Theta1'; % results in [25, 5000]
a2 = sigmoid(z2); % results in [25, 5000]
a2 = [ones(m,1) a2]; % results in [26, 5000]

% Calculate the output layer of the NN
% size(a2) = 26 * 5000
% Theta2 = 10 * 26
z3 = a2 * Theta2'; % results in [10, 5000]
a3 = sigmoid(z3); % results in [10, 5000]

% calculating max on the transpose of a3 so the index 
% result, p, has the expected dimensions [5000, 1]
[h, p] = max(a3, [], 2);
